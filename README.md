**Links:** Random number between 8 to 12

**Size of Links:** Cube of x, y, z dimensions randomized from a range of 0 to 1 for each dimension.

**Placement of Sensors/Motors:** 4 Sensors placed randomly within the chain. Each sensor is placed at a different link so there will always be 4 sensors and motors.

## How to Run:

Download repository, run search.py and it will generate one snake for viewing :). Must have python3 and pybullet installed.

## Notes:

Snake spawns to the left of the camera, might have to pan camera to the left to see him. Cube generated on origin can be tossed away by the mouse. It is not part of the snake.

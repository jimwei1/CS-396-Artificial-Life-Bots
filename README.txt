Hi Donna :)

Assignment 5:
- Fitness Function: Most negative X of the Create_Ball() function (ball.urdf).
- Created a snake that can move to push the ball as far towards the negative X direction as possible.
- Lowered gravity slightly to make it easier for snake to push ball
- Snake doesn't always go forwards due to variance in generation.
